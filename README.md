# CollapsingCrates
Games Programming

This is an early example of a game which I have created using SDL. The intended goal of the game was to climb the crates as they fell,
making sure not to have a crate fall on you as this would result in a game over.

Unfortunately, this game is not complete as I could not get the collision detection working between the player and the crates.
However, it does still spawn the crates in a psuedo-random nature, and the player can still move around.
There is also still working collision detection between the crates which is logged in the console.
